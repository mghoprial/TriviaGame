This is the hardest quiz ever created.  You have been warned...

//*****Psu-Psu-Psudo-Code-Psu-Psu-Psudo-Code-**************
//start button
//make a timer that counts down from 30 seconds.  Alert if Time is up
//create multiple choice or T/F questions with checkmarks that fill
//need to create a "complete" button
// tally a score when "complete" button is hit while also stopping timer
//*********************************************************
still need to make buttons pick true OR false
the alert should show the score of the user
complete button should finish quiz


need to store answers on what people click


make sure T/F are showing
something is wrong with their values 

compare the values and update a score
